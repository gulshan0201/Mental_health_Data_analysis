üß© Task Overview: What We Did
‚úÖ Data Preparation

Checked for missing values.

Cleaned and converted categorical data to numerical (YES ‚û°Ô∏è 1, NO ‚û°Ô∏è 0) for analysis.

‚úÖ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualised distributions of features.

Analysed class imbalance in Expert Diagnose.

Examined relationships between mood swings, suicidal thoughts, and other factors.

Detected outliers using boxplots.

Explored correlations between numerical features using heatmaps.

‚úÖ Insights Generation

Identified which emotional and behavioral traits are strongly associated with expert diagnoses.

Visualised key mental health patterns that could help in early identification.

‚úÖ Tools & Libraries Used

Pandas: Data handling and transformation

Seaborn & Matplotlib: Data visualisation (histograms, countplots, boxplots, heatmaps)

Jupyter Notebook: To build and document the analysis step-by-step.

In short:
We turned raw, categorical patient data into actionable insights about mental health patterns using Python‚Äôs data analysis stack.
